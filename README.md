The primary focus is on comprehending customer purchasing behaviors and refining sales strategies to enhance business outcomes.
## Goal
The goal of this case study is to aims to demonstrate how data analytics can be effectively applied to drive strategic initiatives and achieve sustainable growth in the dynamic and competitive landscape of online retail.
## Step-by-Step Process
**1. Data Loading**
  * Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
  * Check for missing values and data types.

**2. Data Cleaning**
  * Handle missing values (e.g., drop or impute).
  * Convert data types as necessary (e.g., dates to datetime objects).
  * Remove or correct erroneous data (e.g., negative quantities or prices).

**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
  * Descriptive statistics for numerical columns.
  * Distribution of key variables.
  * Analysis of sales over time.
